     You awaken beneath a twilight sky, stretched across a field of cracked stone and wild grass.
     Ahead lies the mouth of an ancient ruin — its archway broken, its shadows deep.
     The wind carries whispers of forgotten heroes… and things best left buried.
     This is where your journey begins.
     You take your first step into the unknown.
      _______________________
     You enter a quiet, dust-covered chamber. Cracks spiderweb across the stone walls, and the air smells ancient.
     Cobwebs stretch between broken furniture and a faded mural whispers tales of forgotten times.
     This place feels abandoned… but not hostile.
      _______________________
     The walls here whisper. Actual voices. Not loud — just barely audible, as if the stone remembers every footstep, every scream. 
     Your torch flickers violently. Something doesn't want you here. 
      _______________________
     Abandoned tools and shattered glass litter the floor. Strange symbols are scrawled across the tables. 
     This was once a place of creation, but now it stinks of rot and regret.

      _______________________
     The cave seems to shift behind you — the entrance now distant, if it even exists at all.
     On the walls, symbols you hadn’t seen before now glow faintly, pulsing with each heartbeat.
     A strange sensation creeps into your mind — not danger, but recognition.
     Something in this place knows you're here.

      _______________________
     An ancient intersection. Four paths converge beneath a shattered stone arch etched with unreadable runes. 
     Each road feels charged with its own energy — like fate itself waits for your next step.

     A natural cavern opens wide, supported by jagged pillars.
     Faint glowing moss clings to the walls, casting an eerie green hue. 
     The silence here is heavy — not threatening, just… watching.
      _______________________
     You find a chamber filled with broken stone faces, staring blankly into the dark.
     One of them matches your own — cracked and weeping black dust.
     A voice echoes from the walls, speaking your name in a tongue you've never learned.
     The echo doesn't stop. It follows you into the next tunnel.

     A circular room appears, carved with scenes of a great betrayal.
     At the center stands a monument — your weapon, buried in stone, older than you remember.
     Visions burn into your mind: you’ve been here before… and you failed.
     Your journey wasn’t the beginning. It’s a return.
